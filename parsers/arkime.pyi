""" 
Callback called for the first packet of a session in each direction that matches
the registered TCP/UDP/port classifiers.

Args:
    session: The opaque session object, used with any arkime_session module methods.
    packetBytes: The memory view of the packet bytes; only valid during the callback.
    packetLen: The length of the packet in bytes.
    direction: The direction of the packet; 0 for client to server, 1 for server to client.

Usage:
    The callback should inspect the bytes to determine the protocol.
    If recognized, it usually calls arkime_session.add_protocol or
    arkime_session.register_parser.

    Create a new field that can be used in sessions. This method returns a fieldPosition that can be used in other calls for faster field access.

        fieldExpression: The expression used in viewer to access the field.
        fieldDefinition: The definition of the field from custom-fields.
